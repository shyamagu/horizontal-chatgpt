# Horizontal ChatGPT

This is a horizontal version of ChatGPT deployed on Azure StaticWebApps using Azure OpenAI Services. Unlike the traditional vertical ChatGPT, this version offers a different approach to conversational AI.

## Usage

Using Horizontal ChatGPT is simple. You only need to provide the following initial configurations:

- Azure OpenAI Services endpoint
- Azure OpenAI Services ChatGPT model name
- Azure OpenAI Services API Key

## Deployment

The Horizontal ChatGPT is deployed on Azure StaticWebApps and can be accessed using the following URL: [https://salmon-beach-093e71f00.3.azurestaticapps.net/](https://salmon-beach-093e71f00.3.azurestaticapps.net/).

## Functionality

Horizontal ChatGPT leverages Azure OpenAI Services to process user inputs and generate responses. It is designed for advanced analysis and complex processing tasks. Unlike the raw OpenAI Service, this version offers enhanced capabilities.

## Data Privacy

Please note that no user input or key information is stored by this application. However, if you have concerns, you can either regenerate your keys regularly or clone this repository and deploy it on your own Azure StaticWebApps instance after reviewing the code.
